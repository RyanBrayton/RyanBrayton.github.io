                    <p>Ryan Brayton is a recent graduate from UTSA.</p>

                    <p>He has completed a successful internship at Southwest 
                    Research Institute as a Student Engineer during the Fall 
                    and Spring semesters of his last year in college. While 
                    employed, Mr. Brayton co-designed and fully implemented an 
                    interactive multi-level menued user interface from scratch using 
                    an LCD screen he connected to a PIC microcontroller. With 
                    grace and ingenuity, he RAM optimized the design by 50% using 
                    static elements made to look dynamic and interactive. During this 
                    process Ryan took initative in creating documentation outlining 
                    the functionality and structure of the menus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ryan also contributed greatly to testing flight 
                    software using python scripts to guide manual and 
                    automated testing of the C based software. These tests 
                    caught 15+ errors and even detected some hardware faults. 
                    He always brought these errors to the teams attention for 
                    correction. </p>
                    
                    <p>Also during Ryan's last year at UTSA, he was privilaged to 
                    lead the UTSA chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) ECE honor 
                    society. This lead to another successful year of eight 3 
                    hour sessions of PCB soldering workships, which taught over 
                    200 students how to put together there microcontroller kits. 
                    Concurrently, Ryan assumed the leadership of his senior 
                    design team, where he lead them to successful completion 
                    of a safe control system for an FSAE electric car. </p>
                    
                    <p>Before this turn of events, Ryan left his job at Dunkin' Donuts
                    and pursued the accomplishments mentioned. This sacrifice shows
                    the go-getter attitude Ryan has to jump out of a place of 
                    comfort and into a field completely new in order to contribute
                    to a community and culture of technological advances. During
                    that summer after leaving, Ryan even initiated a research position 
                    w/ a professor and lead a summer camp. </p>
                    
                    <p>Before this turning point, Ryan displayed a focus seen by his 
                    sucess in school. He always acheived high marks (3.77 GPA) even 
                    while working 30 hours/week and still made time to help fellow 
                    classmates.               </p>
